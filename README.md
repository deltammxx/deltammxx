# Kumusta! I'm David 👋

## About Me

I'm a technology consultant based in Washington, D.C., currently working with Oracle EPM Cloud systems to help federal agencies modernize their financial operations. While I've gotten pretty good at ETL pipelines and automating workflows for 100+ users, my heart is set on returning to the world of solution engineering.

I had the chance to intern as a Solution Engineer at DocuSign back in 2022, and it completely changed my perspective on what technical work could be. I loved the energy of demo environments, the challenge of translating complex requirements into elegant solutions, and most importantly, the direct impact on customers' success.

## What I'm Up To

- 🔭 **Currently working on:** Building out my GitHub portfolio, exploring REST APIs, learning how to work with AI effectively, and somehow still improving batch scripts in 2025
- 🌱 **Currently learning:** REST API integrations, prompt engineering, and how to bridge my enterprise experience with modern SaaS tools
- 👯 **Looking to collaborate on:** Building killer demo environments and REST API projects - let's make technical demos that actually excite people!
- 🤔 **Looking for help with:** Strengthening my GitHub profile and showcasing enterprise experience in a way that resonates with innovative tech companies
- 💬 **Ask me about:** DEIB initiatives that actually work, systems thinking in practice, or how organizational development can transform team dynamics
- 😄 **Pronouns:** he/him
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I can pronounce "Pinakanakapagpapabagabag-damdamin" (the longest word in Tagalog) and I'm currently learning Spanish - ¡Hola!

## Background

- 🎓 B.S. Industrial & Systems Engineering from Virginia Tech (Go Hokies!)
- 💼 Oracle EPM, SQL, Python, PowerShell, and a growing collection of API integrations
- 📜 Certified Scrum Master & Demo2Win certified
- 🌱 Former lead of DEI initiatives and analyst onboarding programs
